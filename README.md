Emotion Recognition with Deep Learning

This project focuses on emotion recognition using deep learning techniques. It involves training and evaluating models to classify emotions from facial expressions. The dataset used is the FER2013 dataset, which contains images labeled with various emotional states.

Key Features:
Data Processing: Preprocessing and augmentation of facial image data to enhance model performance.
Model Architecture: Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) tailored for emotion classification tasks.
Training: Implementation includes training scripts with customizable hyperparameters.
Evaluation Metrics: Detailed analysis using accuracy, loss curves, and confusion matrices.
Applications: Useful for real-time emotion detection systems, human-computer interaction, and psychological studies.

Dataset:
Source: FER2013 (Facial Emotion Recognition dataset)
Emotions Covered: Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, Fearful, Disgusted, and Neutral.

How to Use:
Clone the repository.
Install required dependencies.
Run the training script with your desired parameters.
Evaluate the trained model on test data or deploy it for real-time predictions.
