# Emotion-Recognition
The aim of this project is to develop an emotion recognition system that accurately identifies and classifies human emotions from facial expressions using deep learning techniques. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the system aims to analyze facial features and distinguish between various emotional states.
